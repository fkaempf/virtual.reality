"""Archived original scripts from virtual.fly and screen.calibration.

This package contains the original monolithic scripts preserved for reference.
These files are not imported by the new modular codebase. They document the
evolution of the system from 2D sprites to full 3D GLB rendering.

Do not modify files in this package. Use the new modular modules instead.
